## About This Project

This interactive web game was created to demonstrate six innovative AI project concepts tailored for SITA, a leading provider of technology solutions for the air transport industry. Each collectible in the game represents a different AI project idea that could enhance passenger experience, operational efficiency, and sustainability in the aviation sector.

## How to Play

- **Controls**: Press SPACE or click/tap to make the bird flap and navigate
- **Objective**: Collect all six AI project items while avoiding the green pipes
- **Features**:
  - When you collect a project item, the game pauses to display detailed information
  - Press E to resume gameplay after reading about a project
  - The restart button allows you to begin again at any time

## SITA AI Projects Featured

1. **AI-Powered Passenger Flow Prediction Tool**
   - Uses historical passenger data to predict bottlenecks at different airport touchpoints
   - Helps reduce congestion and improve the overall traveler experience

2. **Digital Travel Credential Simulator**
   - Demonstrates how biometric identity verification works in the airport environment
   - Streamlines passenger processing and enhances security

3. **Flight Sustainability Optimization Dashboard**
   - Visualizes flight paths and identifies fuel-saving opportunities using machine learning
   - Reduces aviation's environmental impact through optimized flight operations

4. **Baggage Journey Anomaly Detection**
   - Detects potential baggage handling issues before they occur
   - Proactively identifies problems rather than reactively solving them

5. **AI-Powered Airport Resource Optimization**
   - Efficiently distributes airport staff and equipment using AI
   - Integrates artificial intelligence into day-to-day operations planning

6. **Generative AI Assistant for Travel Disruptions**
   - Provides a conversational AI interface for handling passenger queries during flight disruptions
   - Offers personalized support during stressful travel situations
